- step 1: Craete a virtual environment for your os, activate it and install libraries using the requiremnts.txt
- step 2: Start the electron app using npm start inside the elctron folder # should still add code to run from other paths

## use Your theme 
There are 4 stylesheets provided, use the one you like by replacing the base sheet in ``` index.html```

2. Connect the front end to back end -HP
    - process button to trigger filesene
    - accept button to trigger json to backend and write
