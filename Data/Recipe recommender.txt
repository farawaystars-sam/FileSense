Recipe Recommendation from the Ingredients 
System Flutter
1) Background/ Problem Statement
People nowadays become very much health conscious and, they try to 
take at most healthy food in their meal. An appropriate food recipe 
must require serving the real taste of the food and a balanced diet, and 
healthy life. As we all know, health is wealth, so food selection is 
essential for better health. 
Sometimes people pick some ingredients that they do not even know 
their names. Or pick up some ingredients from a grocery store, but they 
do not know how to make recipes using those ingredients. For a 
beginner, it is very challenging to select a recipe just by seeing the
ingredients. Even for an expert cook, it is also problematic. 
Our flutter-based Recipe Recommendation System helps users by 
recommending recipes from the given food ingredients. The system 
implements an approach to recognizing food ingredients, and after 
analyzing and classifying these recognized ingredients, food that can be 
cooked with compatible recipes will be recommended.
