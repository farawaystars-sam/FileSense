1. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
 1.1 IPR and its Types
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are legal protections granted to creators 
and inventors for their intellectual creations. These rights allow creators to 
benefit from their work and prevent unauthorized use or exploitation. IPR 
promotes innovation, creativity, and economic growth by providing 
incentives for individuals and organizations to invest time and resources 
into developing new ideas, technologies, and artistic works. The main types 
of IPR include patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, industrial 
designs, and geographical indications.
The main types of IPR include:
• Patents: Protect new inventions and technological innovations.
• Copyrights: Safeguard original literary, artistic, and musical works.
• Trademarks: Protect distinctive signs, symbols, or names used to identify
products or services.
• Trade Secrets: Protect confidential business information that provides a 
competitive advantage.
• Industrial Designs: Protect the visual design of objects that are not purely 
utilitarian.
• Geographical Indications: Identify a product as originating from a specific 
region where a given quality or reputation is attributable to its 
geographical origin
